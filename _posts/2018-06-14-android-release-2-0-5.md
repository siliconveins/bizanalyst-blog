### Sales Reports by Ledger Group Heirarchy
- We have added a completely new way of analysing your data by ledger group. You can now analyse sales and purchase using the Group By feature in sales and view the heirarchical sales numbers of each ledger group.
- On the dashboard, click 'Sales' -> Group By 'Ledger Group'. Now click on the plus button on the left to expand the details in each ledger group.


### Timezone
- For our users outside India, you can now set the timezone of your companies to ensure that the data shows up correctly.
- You can change it by clicking on top left menu bar, tap 'Settings' -> 'Date' -> 'Default Tiemzone' and change it to your country.

### Miscellaneous
- Update profile information like name and phone number
- Gap in invoice while sharing as PDF fixed
- Number to words in Invoice sharing by PDF is now in Indian format
- Added party name column in ledger report for account groups
- UI and bug fixes

If you have any requests/suggestions, please use the report issue feature in the app or send us an email at contact@siliconveins.com
