### Pending Sales Order
Now view your pending sales order so that you can keep track of sales orders that need to be converted to invoices. By default, all the orders are grouped by the ledger and then for each ledger you can view all the pending sales orders. For each order, you can also view all the items that are pending and quantity for the same.
