Now, switch to the ![latest version (1.4.6) of Biz Analyst for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.bizanalyst). Enjoy analyzing your data and day to day activities with simplicity:

PDF Preview Configuration
=========================
Now you can configure your app to view the PDF preview every time before sharing a PDF through any of the supported applications. Change this configuration by going to 'Settings -> Share -> PDF Preview'. This makes it extremely easy to verify the data you are about to share through PDF and verify if it accurate and similar to what you share from your Tally ERP9.

HSN Code
========

Pre-filled Email Address
========================
For users who have inserted the ledger email address in the ledger details in Tally, now when you share any report from Biz Analyst Android App from the email address is pre-filled. This makes it even faster to email reports to your customer.

Auto-sync Issue
===============
Some of the android devices faced problems with auto-syncing because of battery optimizations by the corresponding android OS. We have fixed this and now made it restart the sync whenever the user starts the app.
