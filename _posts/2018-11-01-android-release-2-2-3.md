### Screenwise permissions
- We are excited to bring a new feature where you can further restrict access to your salesperson by blocking access to certain screens. For example, if you wish that your salesperson should not see the dashboard, then you can turn that off.
- To enable this feature:
 1. Select the company first.
 2. Click on the menu bar on the top left side and select 'Users'.
 3. Select the user whose permissions needs to be changed.
 4. Scroll down and see the 'Access by Screen' section. Click on it.
 5. Enable the switches for the screens for which you wish to give permissions.
 6. Click the button on the top right.
 7. Click 'Save' button at the bottom.
- What are you waiting for? Add your sales team to Biz Analyst right away and unlock the growth opportunities for your business.


### New features
- Added custom days filter in Inactive Items & Inactive Customers. Now, you can view all your customers and items that are inactive from a specified date.
- While sharing Oustanding bills for a given ledger by PDF, we are now showing OnAccount bill details along with outstanding bills.
