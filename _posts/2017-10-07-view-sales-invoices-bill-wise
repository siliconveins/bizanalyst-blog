## View sales/purchase vouchers bill wise

You are using Biz Analyst and you want to access your sales vouchers bill wise like you do in Tally? Follow these simple steps to view the data bill wise.

1. Go to Daybook report in the Reports screen
2. Click on the filter icon on the top, you will see the list of all the vouchers. If you would like to view only sales vouchers, then select only the sales voucher type in that list. On doing that you will only see all the sales bill sorted by date and bill wise.
3. You can also change the date using the calendar icon on the top right side to view all the sales vouchers for a specific date period.
