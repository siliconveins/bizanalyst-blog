### Outstanding (Receivable/Payable) ageing report
- For receivables/payables, while filtering data we were showing options like 0-30, 30-60, 60-90 etc to filter the list by bills pending in the selected range. However we have now changed that to all pending bills >0, >30, >60, >90 etc so that sharing bills older than a given range becomes easier as compared to before.
- The graph of ageing bills will be same as it used to be before.


### Miscellaneous
- Turning off daily notifications was not working because of a bug. We have fixed that now.
- Added date while sharing outstanding of a customer as PDF
- Fixed UI issue, where the unit was coming twice while sharing an invoice as PDF
- Now, you can share ledger statements of bank and cash accounts as well from the app
- Fixed an issue where certain items where not shown to users who had restricted permissions.


### Surprise Feature
- Over the last month, we have been working a new surprise feature which is currently in beta and should be launched within the next 2-3 weeks.


If you have any requests/suggestions, please use the report issue feature in the app or send us an email at contact@siliconveins.com
