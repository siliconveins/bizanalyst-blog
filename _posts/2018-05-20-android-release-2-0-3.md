### Create Sales Orders, Receipts & Quotations
- In this release we are launching creation of sales orders, receipts and quotations directly from the mobile app.
- Users can mark the status of each entry created.
- Entries created from the mobile can be configured to be sent by email to a specified email address. This can be useful to send it to the accounting team so that it can be entered back in Tally. We do not support auto integration with Tally as of now.
- This module is currently in Beta and is available free of cost, however it will charged separately from Data reporting feature.
- If you have any suggestions/issues, do write to us at help@siliconveins.com and provide us your registered email address.


### Miscellaneous
- Bugs and UI fixes


If you have any requests/suggestions, please use the report issue feature in the app or send us an email at contact@siliconveins.com
