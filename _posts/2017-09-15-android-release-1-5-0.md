### Fingerprint sensor for passcode unlocking
- We are excited to enhance the security of the application for devices that have a fingerprint sensor. With this, you can unlock the application if you set a passcode using a fingerprint. We highly recommend using a passcode for Biz Analyst application to secure your data from unauthorized users. With the fingerprint sensor, you can unlock the Biz Analyst app using your fingers in a breeze. No more typing again and again.


### Daybook Filter by Voucher Types
- Filter your daybook data by voucher type. This could be useful if you are used to seeing the 'Sales Register', 'Purchase Register', 'Journal Register' in your Tally ERP9.
- Just open the Daybook Report, click on the filter icon on the toolbar at the top and select 'Sales' to view the Sales Register


### Default Start Screen
- In this release, we bring the ability to change the default start screen of the app. This configuration can be done from 'Menu -> Settings -> Default Screen'. This feature will help overcome privacy concerns about opening the app while you are in a public space. Just set, the party list, item list or the reports list as the start screen and so that the high level summary in dashboard is not visible to other people in vicinity.


### Share by PDF/Excel
In this release we bring the sharing capabilities to the following 3 reports:
- Stock Summary By Stock Group and Stock Category
- Search by Party: Items Sold / Items Purchased
- Search by Item: Party Sold / Party Purchased


### Miscellaneous
- View the Quantity in the Top report for Items Sold/Items Purchased along with the amount.
- Plus a number of bug fixes and minor improvements.
