### Simple, Compound and Alternate Unit in Inventory
- Till now, we were only supporting Simple units for inventory quantity. In this release, we bring a major change to show compound units and alternate units everywhere. 
- Note that, this change will activate after the next version of desktop app goes live.


### Improvements
- Inactive Items report is now sorted by Last Sale date by default
- Added a setting ('Settings -> Invoice -> Header) to change the default header for Sales and Purchase invoices
- In Ledger Report, we have added the reference number (invoice no. of the creditor)
- Open Maps app on clicking address in ledger information screen.


### Bug fixes
- Fixed the issue with dashboard loading slow, which was introduced in the last release. If you are still facing problems, please report an issue using the mobile app
- Fixed bug with cheque number not showing.
- Bug fixes and other improvements.


If you have any requests/suggestions, please use the report issue feature in the app or send us an email at contact@siliconveins.com
