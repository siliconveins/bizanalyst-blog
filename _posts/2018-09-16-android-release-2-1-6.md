### New features
- Now you can sort by quantity in Inactive items report and quickly identify your inactive items by quantity or the volume it occupies in your godown.
- Previously, you could share your company's bank details while sharing invoice or outstanding report to your customer. We have extended this feature to receipts and payments as well.
- While profiling an item, we displayed the sales/purchase values of an item month wise. We have now enabled clicking on any month to view all the bills of that stock item for the selected month.


### Miscellaneous
- Now you can also view the standard price / standard cost while searching for an item via stock category and stock group
- Fixed an edge case with outstanding calculation
- Fixed an issue where customer last sale was not getting calculated in certain cases.
- Bug fixes and UI improvements


If you have any requests/suggestions, please use the report issue feature in the app or send us an email at contact@siliconveins.com
