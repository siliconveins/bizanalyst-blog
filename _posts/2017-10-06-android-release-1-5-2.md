## View new features in update
- With this release, we add support to view all the new features that are available whenever we push out an update.
- When a new update is available, a dialog will pop up on your app that will show you the features in the new app and ask you to update the app.

## Print Reports
- Now while sharing a report, you will also see an option to print reports directly from your app. If you have configured a printer in your android phone, this should work out of the box. Else, you will have to configure the printer first on your mobile.
- One can also save the file as PDF instead of printing a hard copy

## Miscellaneous
- Bug fixes and Improvements
