## PDF Preview Configuration
Now you can configure your app to view the PDF preview every time before sharing a PDF through any of the supported applications. Change this configuration by going to 'Settings -> Share -> PDF Preview'. This makes it extremely easy to verify the data you are about to share through PDF and verify if it accurate and similar to what you share from your Tally ERP9.
  

## Pre-filled Email Address
For users who have inserted the ledger email address in the ledger details in Tally, now when you share any report from Biz Analyst Android App from the email address is pre-filled. This makes it even faster to email reports to your customer.


## HSN Code
Now view the HSN code of any inventory in Items, Stock Group list and Item Summary screen


## Auto-sync Issue
Some of the android devices faced problems with auto-syncing because of battery optimizations by the corresponding android OS. We have fixed this and now made it restart the sync whenever the user starts the app.


## Misc
+ Configuration to share narration in ledger report (Settings -> Ledger Report)
+ While sharing PDF in Invoice format, view Bill of lading no & LR no
+ In ledger report, click on closing balance to scroll to bottom & click on opening balance to scroll to top
