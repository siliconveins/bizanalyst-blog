## Invoice Voucher Details and Sharing Improvements
In this release, we bring across to you a number of changes in your Tally sales and purchase vouchers and the corresponding PDF invoice that is generated while sharing the invoice through PDF to your clients.
1. Buyer Contact details are now visible in the PDF invoice
2. Reduced the font size of the text in the PDF, so that content can fit in one page easily
3. Configurability to add the bank details in the Invoice while sharing it as PDF. Enable this configuration by going to 'Settings -> Share -> Add Bank Details'. In this setting you will see all the bank accounts under the ledger groups 'Bank Accounts' and 'Bank O/D Accounts'
4. Removed VAT/TIN and other fields for GST Invoices
5. View LR/RR and Motor Vehicle No. in Invoices
6. GST Tax % Column in Invoices. This can be enabled using a configuration in your Biz Analyst Android App by going to 'Settings -> Share -> Show GST %'


## Miscellaneous changes
* View the part number in the Items list tab. Couple of releases before, we had added support for item and party aliases as well. All of these fields are searchable like in Tally.ERP9.
* While sharing outstanding message, we now show the total amount as well the overdue amount if there are bills that are not due.
