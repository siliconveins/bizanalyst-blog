## Settings
- Default Date
  * Currently, when the app opens we show the default date as this year. We have now added a setting to change that to 'Today', 'This Week', 'This Month', 'This Quarter', 'This Year' as suitable for your business.
  * Change the default date from 'Settings -> Date Settings -> Default Date'
- Financial Year
  * For our international customers who do not follow the Apr-Mar financial year, we have added a setting in (Settings -> Date Settings -> Financial Year) to change the financial year from Jan-Dec.
- Currency Format
  * We have another setting for our customers outside India, where you can change the format of currency from Indian (Crores, Lakhs, etc) to International (Billions, Millions, etc).
  * Change this setting from 'Settings -> Currency Format'


## Permissions by voucher type
- In this release, we introduce adding permission by voucher type for each. By default, users will have access to all voucher types. If you give a particular user only permission to sales voucher type, then that user will not be able to see the details of any other voucher type except sales.


## Miscellaneous
- While sharing credit note, we showed the quantity and amount as -ve. We have fixed that now.
- Now you view the voucher reference number in daybook for purchase vouchers and also search by it.
- Bug fixes and Improvements
