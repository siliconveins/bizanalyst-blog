### Filter Ledgers by Ledger Group
- In Ledger Report, you can now filter the list of ledgers using a ledger group. So, viewing all the bank ledgers, tax ledgers, etc just got easier than before.

### Place of Supply
- Some business use place of supply in sharing invoice by PDF. We have added support for the same in this release.

### Ageing Graph
- In Receivables/Payables, ageing graph was not visible while selecting a custom date. We have added that now.

### Miscellaneous
- View Purchase Reference Date in Purchase Vouchers
- Minor bug fixes and UI improvements.


- If you have any requests/suggestions, please use the report issue feature in the app or send us an email at contact@siliconveins.com
